                <p>
                  We’re a small team passionate about education, equity, and technology. Our mission is to build a tool that liberates teachers from drilling vocabulary and grammar so that they can engage their students in meaningful communicative activities.

                  Our Values
                </h2>
                <dl>
                  <dt>
                    Think BIG, start small, fail forward
                  </dt>
                  <dd>
                    We tackle big problems and continually question the status quo. We make little bets and take action immediately. And, we fail with enthusiasm and humility, knowing that we’re one step closer to success.

                    Growth through feedback
                  </dt>
                  <dd>
                    We relentlessly give feedback because we know it will help our teammates improve. We take feedback as it was intended and focus on how the new knowledge will move us forward.

                    Savor diversity, embolden exceptionality

                  <dd>
                    Difference is the spice of life! We’re a diverse team and committed to keeping it that way. We love that everyone comes to the table with a unique perspective and we especially love speaking different languages (and food. We also love food). Difference plus excellence makes a team member exceptional. We strive to cultivate excellence and encourage difference.

                  <dd>
                    When we struggle, we share the responsibility. If someone needs help, we all pitch in. When something amazing happens, we share in the excitement.

                  </dt>
                  <dd>
                    We think that teachers are some of the most under-served customers out there. We’re dedicated to making their lives easier because we know that happy teachers make happy students.

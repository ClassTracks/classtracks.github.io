          What Makes ClassTracks Different?
        </h2>
        <p>
          There are other vocabulary tools on the internet that may seem similar to ClassTracks. However, don’t be fooled. ClassTracks is the only vocabulary tool that incorporates all of these features.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            ClassTracks is fully customizable. Teachers can upload vocabulary and use the cloud feature to upload images.
          </li>
          <li>
            ClassTracks uses the scientifically proven method of spaced-repetition to help build and retain students’ memory of target language vocabulary. Students see the word, hear the word, and type the word in both their native language, and in the foreign language they are learning. Words that were more challenging for students to learn are shown more often. Moreover, unlike most spaced repetition programs, students using ClassTracks must attempt to define a term before seeing the correct answer. This ensures that students are using active recall strategies when studying. Most spaced repetition programs allow students to rate their own understanding of each word, leading to inconsistencies and misunderstandings.
          </li>
          <li>
            Teachers have access to their class’s data so that they can see where individual students (or the class as a whole) are struggling. More importantly, students have access to their own data. Students can see what units or vocabulary they are struggling with and can keep track of the amount of points they have accumulated by looking at easy to read graphs and charts.

            Students will be able to review the words they found most difficult.
          </li>
          <li>
            Teachers will be able to make units unlock when certain conditions have been met. For example, if a student completes all of the words in the sports unit the teacher can make a second sports unit with more difficult words unlock automatically.
          </li>
          <li>
            Students that want additional vocabulary or more difficult challenges will be able to do so. For example if a student has just finished learning the words for parts of the body, ClassTracks will suggest other body parts as an extension exercise.
          </li>
          <li>
            Teachers will be able to upload their own sound bites and students will be able to choose among different voices for the audio.

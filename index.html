            At ClassTracks we understand that to master a new language, students need more opportunities to practice authentic communication. As foreign language teachers, we were frustrated with the amount of time we had to spend drilling with our students - a necessary evil, but an evil nonetheless! We set out to create a tool that would help students master the fundamentals more efficiently so that we could spend our time facilitating speaking, listening, reading and writing in the target language instead of drilling. We believe that with ClassTracks and a great teacher, every student can learn to communicate in a new language!

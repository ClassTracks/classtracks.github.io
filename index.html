          “One look and you will see that ClassTracks challenges students through a game-like interface to boost vocabulary and better prepare for every lesson at their own pace. Last year, I had the opportunity to introduce my class members to ClassTracks and I can say with certainty that they engage with the core portion of each class with greater energy and enthusiasm. I can only imagine their growth rate will continue to soar with your help.”

            At ClassTracks we understand that to master a new language, students need more opportunities to practice authentic communication. As foreign language teachers, we were frustrated with the amount of time we had to spend drilling with our students - a necessary evil, but an evil nonetheless! We set out to create a tool that would help students master the fundamentals more efficiently so that we could spend our time facilitating speaking, listening, reading and writing in the target language instead of drilling. We believe that with ClassTracks and a great teacher, every student can learn to communicate in a new language!
